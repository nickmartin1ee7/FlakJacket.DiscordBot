# FlakJacket.DiscordBot
A Discord bot that posts new updates on the war between Ukraine and Russia.

The inspiration came from the liveuamap website having the latest updates, but frequently erroring out when loading; likely because it is not able withstand the influx of concurrent users. This service checks for updates as often as it is configured to, and will ideally reduce the strain on their website while allowing more visibility to the latest news/developments.
